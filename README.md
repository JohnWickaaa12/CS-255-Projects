Project completed in CS-255

Summary of the DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project was for a client who wanted to improve how students prepare for their driving tests. They needed a system that allowed students to register, purchase packages, schedule lessons with instructors, and track their progress. The client wanted both a web-based system and a mobile-friendly option so students could access training materials anytime.

What I Did Well
I think I did a good job gathering and organizing the client’s requirements into clear documents. I was able to translate their business needs into technical language while still keeping it understandable. I also feel like my UML diagrams and use cases captured the main workflows in a way that would be useful for both developers and stakeholders.

What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part, I would improve the system design document by adding more detail about security measures, like user authentication and data encryption. At the time, I kept the design a bit high level, but adding specifics would make the system design stronger and more realistic.

Interpreting the User’s Needs
I made sure to think about the system from the student’s perspective—how they would sign up, schedule lessons, and track their hours. I also thought about instructors and administrators, who need tools to manage students and keep everything organized. Considering user needs is critical because a system might work technically but still fail if it isn’t easy and helpful for the people using it.

My Approach to Software Design
I approach software design by first breaking the problem down into smaller parts—collecting requirements, identifying use cases, and then creating diagrams to visualize how everything connects. I think in the future, I’d like to use more iterative design techniques, where I sketch early prototypes, get feedback, and refine. I’d also like to apply tools like JIRA or Trello to track features and tasks as part of a more Agile approach.
